# Final Project - Introduction to Data Science Course

## Overview
This project is the final assignment for the "Introduction to Data Science" course. The objective is to demonstrate the application of data science principles to a real-world dataset. Our chosen domain is comics, and the data has been crawled from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), a popular platform for anime and manga enthusiasts.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into four Jupyter Notebook files, each representing a distinct step in the data science workflow:

1. **Data_Collecting.ipynb**
   - This notebook contains the code for web scraping the data from MyAnimeList.
   - It outlines the process of extracting and storing the data in a structured format for further analysis.

2. **Data_Exploration_and_PreProcessing.ipynb**
   - This notebook focuses on exploring the collected data to understand its structure and content.
   - It includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Asking_Questions_and_Analyzing.ipynb**
   - In this notebook, we define key questions and hypotheses about the data.
   - It includes visualizations and statistical analyses to extract insights and answer the formulated questions.

4. **Data_Modelling.ipynb**
   - This notebook involves building and evaluating machine learning models based on the prepared dataset.
   - The models aim to predict or classify based on specific features of the comic data.

## Data Source
